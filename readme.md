# Elementor Pagination Nofollow Plugin

This WordPress plugin adds the `rel="nofollow"` attribute to pagination links generated by Elementor.

You will want this because the pages of your blog will be crawled by google and eat up your crawl budget. Since the blog pages should be in your sitemap anyway, this plugin will prevent google from crawling those pages multiple times.

If you see `noindex` warnings in Google Search Console with URLs looking like `https://<yoursite>/category/<your category>/?e-page-4123213=1` then this plugin will help remove these.

## Description

The Elementor Pagination Nofollow plugin automatically adds the `rel="nofollow"` attribute to pagination links in Elementor-generated content. This can be useful for SEO purposes by preventing search engines from crawling pagination links.

## Installation

Upload the plugin zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/ddikman/elementor-pagination-nofollow/releases) to your wordpress site. That's it.

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin works automatically with no configuration required.
